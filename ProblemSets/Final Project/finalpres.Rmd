## Introduction 
- OK is 6th in the nation for solar potential, but much lower in installed capacity
- Goal is to map ideal spaces for large-scale solar farms
- Comparative within Oklahoma because of bounds, least-most ideal, not absolute

## Data Collection/Description
- Solar irradiance (brighter is better, Mesonet data)
- Land gradient (< 3%, USGS DEM elevatin data)
- Land cover data (only appropriate land use, USGS satellite data)
- Land price data per census tract (cheaper is better, US census data)

## Methods
- Multicriteria Decision Analysis
- Spatial interpolation (Ordinary Kriging)
- Map projecting / data wrangling

## Findings
- Western Oklahoma is the best, Eastern Oklahoma is the worst
- Significant portions of the state are untenable for land use/gradient reasons
- Suitability gradient also follows temperature / moisture gradient

## What did we learn?
- Anecdotal beliefs about Oklahoma's solar potential are correct
- Despite decent solar suitability, Oklahoma City is far more expensive than other options
